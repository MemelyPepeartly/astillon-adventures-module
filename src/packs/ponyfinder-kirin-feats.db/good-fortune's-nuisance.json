This reaction has the misfortune trait. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again for 10 minutes. Critical Success: The target is unaffected. Success: The triggering attack suffers a -2 circumstance penalty. Failure: The target must reroll the natural 20 on a d20 roll and take the worse result. Critical Failure: The target's attempted roll is resolved as a NAT 1."
